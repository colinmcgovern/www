<h1>HbA1c Peak Analysis Library</h1>
While at Sepax Technologies, I was part of the team of engineers who pioneered our first equipment development project, The GlyHb-100 machine. The purpose of the GlyHb-100 machine is to analyze blood samples for signs of diabetes. Each blood sample takes less than one minute to be tested and has a queue which is able to hold hundreds of samples.<br><br>

After doing preliminary research for the machine, I took responsibility of the machine's peak analysis. When the machine runs a blood sample through one of our HPLC columns, a chromatograph is formed. By separating the chromatograph into its constituent peaks, we can find the concentration of certain markers in a blood sample. To be easily integrated into the larger project, my library was written in C++ on the Qt framework. This project was very difficult and forced me to grow immensely as a Software Engineer.<br><br> 

Three challenges with this project was:<br> 

1. Finding the peak areas accurately (<0.01% room for error)<br>
2. Labeling the peaks with the correct blood marker names<br>
3. Making the library work reliably and NEVER crash<br><br>
